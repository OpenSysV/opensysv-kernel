# Unix SVR4 filesystems

## Support
Unix SVR4 supports the following filesystems:

### Real filesystems
* BFS (Boot File System) is used for storing system boot files. Usually reserved for the `/stand` partition.
* S5 is the traditional Unix System V filesystem.
* UFS (Unix File System) is a port of Berkeley FFS (Fast File System) to SVR4.

## Network protocols
* NFS (Network File System) is a network protocol allowing a user to access files over the network.
* RFS (Remote File Sharing) is a AT&T network protocol.

## Pseudo-filesystems
* fdfs (`/dev/fd`)
* procfs (`/proc`)

# opensysv-kernel
The OpenSysV Project kernel source code.

## TODO List
* Make the project into a working state.
* Use GRUB 2 instead of SVR4 bootloader.
* Ensure portability. Then begin ports to other processors.
* Larger hard disks/SSDs. We are currently limited to drives smaller than 504 MB.
* Update networking code.

And much, much more...
